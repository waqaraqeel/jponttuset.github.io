I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University. I joined CS@Duke in Fallâ€™17.

<br/>

I am advised by Dr. Bruce Maggs as part of The Internet at the Speed of Light, where I work on future Internet architectures and measurement. My interests also include content caches and online advertising.

<br/>

Previously, I have mostly worked in web development. I still enjoy doing small web projects on the side. I also enjoy reading historical fiction.
