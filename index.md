I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University. I joined Duke in Fallâ€™17.

My research interests include Internet architecture and measurement, and content caches.

I am advised by Dr. Bruce Maggs.

Previously, I have worked in web development. I still enjoy doing small web projects on the side. I also enjoy reading historical fiction.
