I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University. I joined Duke in Fallâ€™17.

I am advised by Dr. Bruce Maggs. I am associated with The Internet at the Speed of Light where I work on future Internet architectures and measurement. My interests also include content caches and online advertising.

Previously, I have worked in web development. I still enjoy doing small web projects on the side. I also enjoy reading historical fiction.
