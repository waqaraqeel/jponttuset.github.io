I am currently visiting MIT CSAIL. I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University. I joined CS@Duke in Fallâ€™17.

<br/>

I am advised by Prof. Bruce Maggs as part of The Internet at the Speed of Light project, where I work on future Internet architectures and measurement. My interests also include online advertising, web performance, and DNS.

<br/>

Previously, I have mostly worked in web development. I still enjoy doing small web projects on the side. I also enjoy reading historical fiction.
