I am currently visiting MIT CSAIL in Prof. Dina Katabi's lab.

I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Duke University,
where I am advised by Prof. Bruce Maggs as part of The Internet at the Speed of
Light project. I work on future Internet architectures and measurement. My
interests also include online advertising, web performance, and DNS.
